		<p>I rank for some of the most competitive keywords on Google. From “seo” to “online marketing,” I dominate the search listing pages.
Can you guess how I was able to do this?
Well, it’s not because I am smarter than you… because I am not.
Instead, I’ve been practicing digital marketing since 2001. After a while, you learn what works and what doesn’t.
So, if you want to achieve similar results, you have two options:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Option 1:</b> Follow the cheat sheet below. It really works, you just have to put in the time and effort. And over time you’ll slowly see your rankings, traffic and revenue climb.</li>
			<li><b>Option 2:</b> Hire my ad agency. If you don’t have the time and need it done for you, check out Neil Patel Digital.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>And of course, you technically have a third option, which is to figure it out on your own. But you opted into my list, so I’m guessing you would rather have the cheat sheet. ;)
So if you want to grow your rankings, just follow the tactics below. But before you start, keep in mind that this is an advanced cheat sheet… so I skipped the basics.</p>
		<p>Here it goes:</p>
		<h3>Find a shoulder niche</h3>
		<p>I think we can all agree that backlinks are one of the most essential elements of SEO.
They’re still a primary currency that search engines examine when determining rankings.
So we break our backs trying to obtain high-quality, relevant backlinks.
But here’s the thing.
It can be tricky getting other sites in your niche to link to you.
After all, you are a competitor.
Linking to you could potentially dilute their rankings, which is especially problematic if you’re competing for those coveted, heavily searched keyword phrases.</p>
		<p>So what’s the solution?
One technique I’ve had success with is finding a shoulder niche, which is a niche that’s closely related to your site’s main topic.
You then create content around that shoulder niche and engage in link outreach like you would normally.
Since you’re not in direct competition with the brands you’re reaching out to, your odds of acquiring quality backlinks should inevitably increase.
So how exactly do you come up with a shoulder niche?
I suggest using Buzzsumo because it will instantly provide you with a lot of different angles on a topic.
And you don’t even need to have a paid account to use it for this purpose.
First you enter a broad phrase.
I’ll just use “weight loss” as an example.
Instantly I get dozens of results.
Right off the bat, this particular piece of content about keto recipes catches my eye.
I know that the ketogenic diet is really popular right now, so targeting that niche could definitely be viable.
Another resource you can use is Google News.
Again, type in a broad keyword and check the results.
After scrolling down a bit, I see another piece on the ketogenic diet.
So just like that I have two potential topics to work with.
At that point, it’s simply a matter of creating great content and reaching out to bloggers and influencers.</p>
	<h3>Use MarketMuse data</h3>
	<p>Remember back in the day when all you had to do to rank well was perform a bit of keyword research and stuff those keywords into a 500-word article?
It was like shooting fish in a barrel.
But those days are long gone and search algorithms are more sophisticated than ever.
The Hummingbird update back in 2013 really changed the game when it introduced latent semantic indexing
(LSI), which made it so Google started looking at the greater whole or the underlying theme of a page rather
than simply keywords.
It’s what helped their algorithm truly grasp the meaning of content.
Fast forward to today, and it’s clear that effective SEO is about comprehensively covering topics rather than just
a few keywords.
One particular tool that I’ve found to be a breakthrough is called MarketMuse, which is “an AI-powered assistant
that accelerates content creation and optimization so you can win in organic search.”
This is an incredibly robust platform that does a few amazing things including the following:
It analyzes a potential topic to help you decide whether it’s worth your time to write content on it
Provides clear-cut recommendations on what to write and how to write it
Provides recommendations on how to optimize existing pages
There’s some crazy advanced AI in place here that’s light years ahead of most other tools. It’s like keyword
research on steroids.
Brafton wrote a recent article that features a case study using MarketMuse that helped them go from the number
16 spot all the way to number 2.
I really like their quote at the beginning that says, “What we really need is an algorithm that understands the
depth, quality and topics that are being discussed for the keyword you are targeting. We need an algorithm that
mimics Hummingbird and gives us a blueprint for who we need to beat and how we need to beat them.”
They then point out that MarketMuse provides that algorithm and explain its features in great detail.
For example, there’s “depth score,” which shows how the quality of your content fares against the competition.
So if you’re looking for a legitimate, next generation SEO tool, I highly recommend taking a look at MarketMuse.
It can help you take your SEO to the next level.</p>
